        "The idea of interface is really simple - it is the description of how an object behaves. An interface tells us what an object can do to play it’s role in a system. In object oriented programming, an interface is a set of publicly accessible methods on an object which can be used by other parts of the program to interact with that object. Interfaces set clear boundaries and help us organize our code better. In some langauges like Java, interfaces are part of the language syntax and strictly enforced. However, in Python, things are a little different. In this post, we will explore how interfaces can be implemented in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Informal Interfaces: Protocols / Duck Typing\n",
        "There’s no interface keyword in Python. The Java / C# way of using interfaces is not available here. In the dynamic language world, things are more implicit. We’re more focused on how an object behaves, rather than it’s type/class.\n",
        "\n",
        "__If it talks and walks like a duck, then it is a duck__\n",
        "\n",
        "So if we have an object that can fly and quack like a duck, we consider it as a duck. This called “Duck Typing”. In runtime, instead of checking the type of an object, we try to invoke a method we expect the object to have. If it behaves the way we expected, we’re fine and move along. But if it doesn’t, things might blow up. To be safe, we often handle the exceptions in a try..except block or use hasattr to check if an object has the specific method.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "In the Python world, we often hear “file like object” or “an iterable” - if an object has a read method, it can be treated as a file like object, if it has an \\_\\_iter\\_\\_ magic method, it is an iterable. So any object, regardless of it’s class/type, can conform to a certain interface just by implementing the expected behavior (methods). These informal interfaces are termed as protocols. Since they are informal, they can not be formally enforced. They are mostly illustrated in the documentations or defined by convention. All the cool magic methods you have heard about - \\_\\_len\\_\\_, \\_\\_contains\\_\\_, \\_\\_iter\\_\\_ - they all help an object to conform to some sort of protocols.\n",
